# One-Shot-Siamese-Network

One shot learning using the Siamese network allows us to identify one person. This model finds similarities and differences between two images.

Here I used facenet.h5, so before using this code, install facenet.h5. To run this program, Python 3 must be installed.

I used Google colab to train and test the model. This model does not have high accuracy.Â
